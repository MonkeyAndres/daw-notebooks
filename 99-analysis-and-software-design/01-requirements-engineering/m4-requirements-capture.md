# Requirements capture

## Understanding this activity

The objective of this activity is to understand:

* The problem we are trying to solve
* The business, how the systems interact with each other, how this system contributes to the business objectives
* Specific needs for the users of the system

The source of this objectives can be: business objectives, improvements of existing systems, stakeholders...

Common problems when capturing requirements:

* The users don't know hot to express their ideas accurately
* This process must be cooperative not passive
* Viewpoints, each role has a segmented vision on the system and our challenge is to express what the client needs in a very precise way for all the roles to understand it

## Requirements capture techniques

### Traditional

Here the main method is doing interviews.

1. Planning
   * What data we want to obtain?
   * Who is interviewed?
   * When?
   * Where?
2. Preparation
   * Collect external info about the problem
   * Prepare questions
   * Research about the interviewed person (job title, personality...)
   * Send event details (date, time, location)
3. Realization
   1. Opening
      * General interview details (duration, objectives)
      * Why this interview is important?
      * Set an informal tone
      * Ask for permission to take notes
   2. Development
      * Better to go 2 people to interview
      * Listen to the interviewed
      * Make sure you understand everything that the interviewed is telling
      * Take detailed notes
      * Don't be passive, ask and encourage
   3. Closing
      * Summary of the notes taken
      * Verify obtained data
      * Thank you for the interview
4. Analysis / Conclusions
   * Review and elaborate conclusions
   * Search for improvement areas for future interviews

### Grupal

Very helpful for obtaining more viewpoints that in individual interviews and for generating discussion. Must be well mediated in order to avoid conflict.

#### Brainstorming

* Objective: obtain creative ideas for solving our problem
* Phases:
  1. Prepare session
     * Select a group of different people
     * Select an objective for the session
  2. Brainstorming
     * Expose the objective of the session
     * Write all ideas with no order
     * Better quantity than quality
     * Associate or modify ideas
     * Make sure all ideas are visible
     * Stop when no more ideas
  3. Evaluate ideas (following day)
     * Same group of people, use the ideas taken in the previous session
     * Evaluate each idea and dig deeper (refine)
     * Associate or merge ideas
     * Select a winning idea
