# Introduction to RE

## What is software engineering?

Various definitions here.

> The utilization of a systematic, disciplines and measurable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of a software.

> Allow us to elaborate consistently correct, usable and cost-effective products.

> Study of the principles and methodologies for the development and maintenance of software systems.

## Requirements engineering (RE)

Is a part of the software engineering process. RE allow us to reach an agreement between developers, clients and users about the requirements of a system, that will stablish the bases for doing a software design, support for the verification and validation of the system and its evolution.

Inside requirements engineering we can recognise two main parts.

* RE process: obtain, analyze specify and validate the document of requirements given by the client
* Requirement management: process of understanding and managing the requirement changes

### Why do RE?

The lack of a good RE can turn into big losses for companies.

Doing a bad RE can snowball really quickly. A bad requirement can lead you to design a bad solution for a problem, this bad solution will be implemented to solve your bad defined problem and be tested according to the parameters of your wrong-made design. All of this can scale up as a project is made of lots of requirements.

### Software quality factors

The software engineering look for the production of quality software and give us some tools to achieve that. However we must understand what do we call quality software.

Quality software is the combination of external factors (factors that the clients of our product can identify) and internal factors (factors that only the designers or developers can identify). From this two the important one is the external factors but without good internal factors we cannot achieve good external factors.

Examples of external factors: maintainability, reliability, efficiency, usability, portability, correction, robustness, compatibility, functionality, extensibility...

Examples of internal factors: modularity, legibility...
