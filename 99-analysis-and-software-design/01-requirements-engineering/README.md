# Requirements engineering <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

The general objective of this course is to learn the process of developing a software specification. In these specifications we try to communicate the client's needs to the software developers. We will also try to see the methods, techniques and tools that allow us to document the system requirements in a reusable way.
